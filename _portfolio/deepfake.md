I developed a batch processing program with SBR algorithm to detect all frames of subjects for landmark detection and calculation of Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR), thereby conducting automatic data cleaning and eye/mouth dynamics analysis, the former is essential for auto-encoder training and the latter is important information that clinicians use to diagnoise Parkinson's Disease.

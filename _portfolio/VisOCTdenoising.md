We provide the first supervised/unsupervised deep learning-based, end-to-end design for visOCT denoising using our speckle reduction scanning dataset. 
The generality and robustness of the trained model was also tested on a Raster scan 3D volume of human retina.

D) The multi B-scans averaged clean image.
